# Description
This is the Inheritance section of the ALX SE program.

# Notes
* `issubclass()` confirms whether the object inherits from a class
* `type()` allows me to confirm whether the object is exactly the same class type
* `isinstance` allows us to check whether the object is anything like a class type
